# password_strength
Test a given password strength using RegEx

This is my first attempt at a password strength tester. This was an exercise for me to bruch up on my RegEx.
The code can be improved in a couple of ways. I may come back and improve it in the future.
  1. Allow the user to input the password and run it against the strength tests.
  2. Consolidate the case, digit, and special character tests into one compile statement using RegEX
  3. Add the option for a user to generate a strong random password.

All feedback is welcome!
